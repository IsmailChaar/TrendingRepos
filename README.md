# TrendingRepos

This is a small webapp that lists the most starred Github repos created in the last 30 days. Done by me for the Gemography Front-end Coding Challenge <3 .

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Choice of technologies

I've choosen Angular for the following :

<ul>
<li>MVC done right</li>
<li>Data models</li>
<li>Directives</li>
<li>Flexibility with binding data</li>
<li>Write less code</li>
<li>DOM manipulations where they belong</li>
<li>Service providers where they belong</li>
<li>Unit testing ready</li>
</ul>

I've used Angular Material, and animate.css .
